  "body": "Holocache is a simple game for the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us). It takes the idea of geocaching and redefines it with an awareness of room-scale 3D scene structure.\r\n\r\nHolocache supports multiple Hololens users, both as cachers or as simultaneous seekers.\r\n\r\nHolocache has an ulterior motive: it is a room scanning assistant that encourages users to look in and scan areas of the scene that have not yet been thoroughly mapped by the Hololens, and can also fuse the scans of multiple users.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nCourse webpage: <http://courses.cs.washington.edu/vrcapstone>",
