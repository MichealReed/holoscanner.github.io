title: "Week 4: Client-Server Communication"
---

This week, we got our basic client-server system up and running (mostly). The Hololens can successfully send meshes to our python server, using the Google protobuf libraries we discussed [last week]({% post_url 2016-04-21-week-3-technical-framework %}). The server was Keunhong's work, while Edward and Alex worked on the Unity/Hololens side of the communications.
Hamid also did some further investigation on the characteristics of the Hololens meshes to better inform server side processing.

## Mesh Analysis

## Plans
While some concrete stuff got done this week, we still don't have our basic gameplay interface. 
This will be the main task for Alex and Edward next week.
Other low-hanging fruit: letting the server send meshes back to the Hololens should be very straightforward now, it's just a matter of implementing it.
Meanwhile, Hamid and Keunhong will start implementing the mesh processing framework (and integrating it with the server) and major data structures.
