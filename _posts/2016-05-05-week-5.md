# Networking
We successfully transmitted all of the mesh data from a Hololense to a server instance. The Hololense coorectly sends a collection of meshes it has scanned together with the timestamps so that the server can handle them accordingly. The server receives the mesh. We now just have to connect the pieces and hand the meshes over to Hamid's code for alignment.
