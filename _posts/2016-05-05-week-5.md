# Networking
We've successfully implemented mesh transfer in both directions (to and from the Hololens). The Hololens can, on command, send a collection of submeshes of the scene to the server, as well as the appropriate timestamps. The Hololens can also request a mesh from the server.   

# Session Logistics & Coordinate System Alignment
We've extended the game loop handler to incorporate session handling (i.e. anchor point generation, player joining, sending anchor points to new players).

# Demo
Our demo currently allows the user to explore the scene, and as the Hololens' internal model is updated, the mesh is periodically sent to the server. The demo application constantly displays the global mesh as it exists on the server. So, when multiple players are connected to the server, the mesh shown will include regions scanned by all of the Hololenses.
The current version of the demo doesn't include any gameplay elements. We have also yet to find a way to easily delete the internal Hololens model of the scene, which causes problems, because the scene will appear to have been scanned by all Hololenses prior to receiving a new one from the server.

# Plans
Game loop (placement of a sphere somewhere in the scene, move it when user clicks on it)
  
  Piping the mesh from the server to our external mesh analysis application and back. This needs to be done quickly enough such that the model in each of the Hololenses are not inconsistent for too long.
