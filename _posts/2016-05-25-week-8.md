# Abstract

Long story short, we now have a working multi-player game with meaningful user interactions.

# Key Contributions

 * Fixed horrible memory leak which was crashing the Hololens.
 * Implemented automatic alignment of Hololens client coordinate systems.
 * Designed and implemented algorithm for automatic detection of areas in need of scanning.
 * Implemented generation of targets at areas which need scanning
 * Improved the user experience of tracking the game state by implementing a innovative real-time web-based graphical user interface (GUI).
 * A novel color-coded visualization system enables the users of the dashboard to differentiate between meshes reported by different Hololens devices.
 * Implemented an integral tracking system which stores the current score of the users in volatile memory.

## Candidate Target Generation

The problem of hole-finding is a classic task in the field of Holoscanning. We present Amazing Hole Finding Heuristic (AHFH) -- a novel hole-finding algorithm which successfully generates candidate targets in locations proximal to holes in the scanned mesh provided by Hololens devices.  

### Computing a Global Map

In order to generate candidate region proposals, we must first have a sense of what area the entire mesh encompasses. A trivial solution would be to compute a convex hull of the current mesh. However, using a convex hull would allow targets to be generated outside the navigable vicinity of the players.

We propose a novel approach which uses advanced graphics and image processing techniques to ascertain the concave hull of the mesh. Our method is as follows:

 1. Render the mesh from a bird's-eye viewpoint using the advanced rendering pipeline--Python Imaging Library (PIL)
 2. Perform a morphological dilation of the resulting mask then immediately perform a morphological erosion of the resulting mask using a kernel size of 0.04 times the smaller dimension of the mask.
 4. Perform an additional morphological erosion using a pre-set hyperparameters in order to ensure that the mapped area is contained within the user's navigable arena.

### Computing Candidate Areas

We perform the same steps for faces only near the floor plane and only near the ceiling plane but without the dilation/erosion hole filling step. By taking the complement of these floor and ceiling maps and intersecting it with the global map, we obtain areas which have holes.

### Generating Targets

We generate targets by uniformly sampling the candidate areas.

### Pushing Targets

Since targets may be generated in close proximity, we ensure that the user explores the world outside their comfort zone by pushing targets reasonably further awayâ„¢ from the last target acquired.


## Dashboard

We present a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for tracking the state of the game and scanning in real-time. This allows a game master (GM) to control and track the flow of the game. Targets may be manually acquired should be fall outside the reach of players.

The dashboard shows the current score, ready status and IP address of the players. A green check mark indicates that the player is ready. The checkbox toggles the visibility of the player's mesh.

## Server-Client Interaction

Our system does not generate targets until all connected Hololenses have indicated that they are aligned and ready to start the game. This status can be tracked in real-time through the dashboard interface.
