---

# Abstract

Long story short, we now have a working multi-player game with meaningful user interactions.

# Tasks Completed

 * Implemented automatic alignment of Hololens client coordinate systems.
 * Designed and implemented algorithm for automatic detection of areas in need of scanning.
 * Implemented generation of targets at areas which need scanning
 * Improved the user experience of tracking the game state by implementing a innovative real-time web-based graphical user interface (GUI).
 * A novel color-coded visualization system enables the users of the dashboard to differentiate between meshes reported by different Hololens devices.
 * Implemented an integral tracking system which stores the current score of the users in volatile memory.
