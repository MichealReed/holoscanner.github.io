Holoscanner is a simple game for the [Microsoft Hololens](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us). It takes the idea of hide-and-seek, but leverages knowledge of room geometry to hide objects behind or around occlusions.

Holoscanner has an ulterior motive, however. It is a game built around the idea of integrating analysis of the Hololens's scans of the real world into the gameplay mechanics, with the intention of encouraging exploration of parts of the world that have yet to be scanned. The goal of Holoscanner is to produce a high-quality scan of the room while the users think they're just playing a game. 

Holocache supports multiple Hololens users, and can also fuse the scans of multiple users.
